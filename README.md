## Project Title

## MVP
- Buy/Sell application - Our application will provide a platform to upload/purchase/allow communication between users to sell items.
- Why is a buting/selling app valuable? - This app will be useful because users can easily fill out a form and post items on the platform easily to sell.
- This app is strictly for people wanting to get rid of items, not merchandise. (kind of like Craigslist, but just selling items and easier to use).
- This app will be useful for people looking for a good deal and not wanting to by brand new items, ex: students looking for a microwave.
